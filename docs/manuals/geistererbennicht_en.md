% Geister erben nicht - Solution Helper


The main window consists of two buttons at the top and 20 lists, where a
word can be chosen that matches the contained picture.

The left button opens a second window that shows the complete picture.
The right one shows the help in the browser.

In each list one word can be chosen. Under the list the number of the
word's letter that contributes to the solution is shown. If a word is
selected, the corresponding letter shows up in the middle. The letter
also appears in the top window border at the corresponding position.

To the right under each list are three buttons:

- The left button emphasizes the background picture, to support spotting
  which word could match.
- The middle button has a pause symbol as known from a media player. If a
  word is selected, it will be fixed in that list and removed from the 19
  other lists. Pushing the button again stops the fix and shows it in the
  other lists again.
- The right button, with the media player stop symbol, deselects the
  word, which causes the solution letter to disappear.
