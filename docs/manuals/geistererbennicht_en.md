% Geister erben nicht - Solution Helper


The main window consists of two buttons at the top and 20 lists, where a word
can be chosen that matches the contained picture.

The left button opens a second window that shows the complete picture. The
right one shows the help in the browser.

In each list one word can be chosen. Under the list the position of the word's
solution letter is shown. If a word is selected, the corresponding letter shows
up after its position indicator. It also appears in the top window
border at the correct place.

To the right under each list are four buttons (from left to right):

1. emphasizes the background picture, to support spotting which word could
   match
1. (pause symbol) fixes the selected word and removes it from the 19 other
   lists. Pushing the button again stops the fix and shows it in the other
   lists again.
1. (stop symbol) deselects the word, which causes the solution letter to
   disappear
1. (play symbol) selects the correct word in the list
